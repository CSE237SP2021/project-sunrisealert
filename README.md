# Sunrise Alerts
A weather news app that will fill you in on all of the greatest headlines that have occurred recently. Will help you stay in shape and have something interesting to talk about in forced Zoom meetings. Also configurable to show your local weather so you know if it's even worth going outside that day.

# Iteration 1
Completed user stories:
  - As a user, I want to receive top news stories for the day
  - As a user, I want to view the weather at my current location
User stories for next iteration:
  - As a user, I want Sunshine Alerts to tell me good morning PERSONALLY
  - As a user, I want Subshine Alerts to compile the links for the top news stories for me
 
Everything we've implemented currently works.
